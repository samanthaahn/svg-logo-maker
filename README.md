# svg-logo-maker

## Description
This project allows users to create their very own SVG logo without having to hire a graphic designer! 

## Installation
In order to use this repo, you have to install inquirer verision 8.2.4, jest, and node.js. 

## Usage
Enter into your terminal and install the necessary packages (inquirer, node, and jest). Once completed, you can type "npm run test" and the program will make sure that all tests are successfully passed so that the code works properly. Then, type "node index.js" into the terminal and 4 promopts will arise. Answer the questions, and it will help you create your very own SVG Logo. The SVG logo is automatically generated once all questions have been answered. 

## Contributing
A special thank you to Bryan, our professor and Shawn our TA. Without their help, none of this would be possible! 

## Tests
Jest was used to ensure that all tests were passed. Type "npm run test" to ensure that all your tests are successful passed.
